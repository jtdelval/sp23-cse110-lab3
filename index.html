        <h3>Ireneo Funes's Progress update</h3>
        Ireneo Funes claims the following occurred, preventing him from making progress on the widget sorter implementation:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Tragedy!!</b>-- he lost an exhuberent amount of money gambling and had to work overtime to pay it off</li>
          <li>He was washing his hair</li>
          <li><strong>Gangstalkers</strong> keep showing up at his house and threatening him</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Above all, <br> he has been too busy reading works by <em>Jorge Luis Borges.</em></p>

        Below is a five-sentence story by Borges which he proceded to read aloud. 
        <details>
          <summary>The Plot</summary>
          <p>To make his horror perfect, Caesar, hemmed about at the foot of a statue by his friends’ impatient knives, discovers among the faces and the blades the face of Marcus Junius Brutus, his ward, perhaps his very son—and so Caesar stops defending himself, and cries out <i>Et tu, Brute?</i> Shakespeare and Quevedo record that pathetic cry.</p>
          <p>Destiny takes pleasure in repetition, variants, symmetries: nineteen centuries later, in the south of the Province of Buenos Aires, a gaucho is attacked by other gauchos. As he falls he recognizes an adopted son of his and says to him with gentle reproof and slow surprise (these words must be heard, not read), <i>Pero che!</i> He is being killed, and he does not know he is dying so that a scene may be repeated.</p>
